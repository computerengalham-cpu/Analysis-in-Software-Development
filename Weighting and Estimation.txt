4. Weighting and Estimation
4.1 Story Point Estimation Techniques

Story Points are a unit of measure to express the complexity, effort, and uncertainty of a user story. They help teams estimate work without tying it directly to hours or days.

4.2 Common Estimation Methods

Planning Poker
Team members estimate using numbered cards, discuss differences, and re-vote until consensus.

T-Shirt Sizing
Assign sizes such as S, M, L, XL to stories based on perceived effort.

Fibonacci Sequence
Use numbers like 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13… to capture increasing uncertainty in estimates.

Bucket System
Group user stories into predefined buckets for faster estimation when handling a large backlog.

4.3 Weighting User Stories

Stories are weighted based on factors that reflect effort, priority, and value:

Technical Difficulty – How complex the story is to implement

Dependencies – Stories that depend on others may need higher weighting

Risks – High-risk stories may require more attention

Time Criticality – Urgent stories can have higher priority

Business ROI – Stories with higher business value get higher weighting

Regulatory or Compliance Needs – Mandatory items get higher priority
