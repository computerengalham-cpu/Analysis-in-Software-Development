The Analysis Phase in Software Development
1.1 Definition and Importance

The Analysis Phase of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is the stage where business needs, stakeholder expectations, and system requirements are thoroughly examined, clarified, and documented.
Its primary goal is to understand what needs to be built before deciding how to build it.

Why it is important:

Prevents costly changes during later stages

Ensures clear communication between stakeholders and developers

Defines scope, constraints, risks, and success criteria

Provides the foundation for design, development, and testing

1.2 Sub-Steps of the Analysis Phase

1. Requirements Elicitation
Collecting requirements using interviews, surveys, workshops, observation, document analysis, and brainstorming.

2. Requirements Classification
Categorizing requirements into functional/non-functional, business/system, mandatory/optional.

3. Requirements Analysis
Evaluating feasibility, resolving conflicts, clarifying ambiguities, identifying dependencies, and detecting constraints.

4. Requirements Modeling
Creating diagrams such as use cases, data flow diagrams (DFD), entity-relationship diagrams (ERD), workflow diagrams.

5. Requirements Specification
Documenting requirements in a formal Software Requirements Specification (SRS) or Agile artifacts (user stories).

6. Requirements Validation
Confirming requirements with stakeholders through walkthroughs, prototypes, and acceptance criteria.

1.3 Deliverables and Outcomes

Primary deliverables:

Software Requirements Specification (SRS)

Use Case Diagrams

Data Models (ERD)

Workflow Charts or Process Maps

Glossary of Terms

Prioritized Requirement List

Initial Product Backlog (in Agile)

Outcomes:

Shared understanding of the system requirements

Documented scope and constraints

Approved baseline for design

1.4 Best Practices & Common Challenges

Best Practices:

Involve all stakeholders early

Use multiple elicitation techniques

Validate requirements often

Use visual models to reduce ambiguity

Maintain traceability of requirements

Keep documentation updated

Common Challenges:

Vague or changing requirements

Conflicting stakeholder expectations

Scope creep

Poor communication

Insufficient domain knowledge
